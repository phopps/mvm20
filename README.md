# Spacegolf

*Fast-paced 2D metroidvania golf platformer.*

Shoot your player through gates to get to the finish portal on each level. Setup your shots by **clicking and dragging** your mouse, then **release** it to shoot your player. Pass through all **gates** to open the **portal**, then get there before it closes!
